# Javascript games

This repository is a list of my games created just by using pure HTML, CSS and Javascript. It is a demonstration of how you can learn basics of web development just by creating these types of simple games that you can play right after you make them. I have made this a challenge and try to develop these by myself without inspiring myself from the internet. I often create these games when I'm on holiday without internet access so I try to be creative and use my programming knowledge.

## Catch the ball
